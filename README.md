[![One HTML Page Challenge](./meta/one-html-page-logo.png?raw=true "One HTML Page Challenge")](https://onehtmlpagechallenge.com/)

The goal is to create anything you want within 1 single html file. Practice your skills with the barebones of web development. **How creative can you be with such restrictions?**

### [View Submissions](https://onehtmlpagechallenge.com)

## Rules
 - You must write all of your code in 1 single HTML file.
 - Your file must be less than 1mb (measured by the file size on github).
 - You cannot import any external files (this will be checked by looking at the network tab in chrome).
 - Due to the nature of hiding lots of funtionality behind APIs, you cannot have any incoming network requests.
 - You are allowed to use libraries, however the library must be hard coded into a script tag and still must fit under the 1MB file size. (I suggest using a cdn and replacing with hardcoding the minified library at the end, or use [JSCompress](https://jscompress.com/)).
 
## How to Submit
 1. Fork the repository.
 2. Add your html file to the `/entries` directory.
 3. Edit the `entries.js` file in the root, with your information for the entry.
 4. Commit to your forked repo.
 5. Make a pull request to master from your forked repo.
 
 _* You may submit as many entries as you'd like._
